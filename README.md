# Grasp

**Air-gapped spatial knowledge for your pocket.**  
Grasp is an iPhone app that turns the camera into a private document and scene vault: capture, understand with on-device AI, and search—without sending your frames to a server.

## Why Grasp?

Subscriptions and cloud OCR are the default. Grasp is built for people who want **ownership**: one-time purchase, **local inference** via [MLX Swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift), and **SwiftData** storage so captures stay on the device you hold.

- **On-device VLM** — Vision-language inference runs locally; no standing connection required after the initial model setup.
- **Thermal-aware** — Inference is serialized and respects system thermal state so the phone stays usable.
- **Memory-conscious** — Images are decoded and resized with streaming paths where it matters; the FIFO queue keeps memory predictable.
- **Semantic search** — Natural-language style discovery over your vault using on-device embeddings and fallbacks.

## Architecture at a glance

| Area | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Inference** | MLX Swift VLM pipeline; streaming decode paths for camera input |
| **Memory** | SwiftData models, external thumbnail storage, bounded queues |
| **Thermal** | `ThermalMonitor` bridges `NotificationCenter` to `AsyncStream`; work pauses when the system needs headroom |
| **Concurrency** | Swift 6–ready code paths; `VLMInferenceActor` and a FIFO queue for ordered inference |
| **Search** | `NLEmbedding` semantic search with a two-phase fallback strategy |

Source layout: `Grasp/Models`, `Grasp/Managers`, `Grasp/Views`, plus `GraspTests` and `GraspUITests`.

## Requirements

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Xcode** | 16+ |
| **SDK** | iOS 26 (as set in the project) |
| **Device** | Physical iPhone recommended (camera, Neural Engine). **A17 Pro** or newer is ideal for MLX performance |

---

## Getting started

1. **Clone** this repository.  
2. **Open** `Grasp.xcodeproj` in Xcode (Swift Package Manager dependencies resolve via the checked-in `Package.resolved`).  
3. **Select** your team and a **physical device** for camera and ML workloads.  
4. **Build and run.** On first launch, the app may **download model weights** over the network; after that, core flows can run without cloud inference.

## Privacy

Processing is designed to stay **on-device**. Grasp does not rely on a Grasp-operated backend for core capture → understand → store flows.
